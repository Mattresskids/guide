How An Isotonic Foam Mattress Pad Works

An isotonic foam mattress pad is known for its ability to mold to the very unique shape and curves of your body. How is this possible? What happens is that the foam reacts to the heat of your body. The foam heats up when you lie down because of your own body temperature. 

As it heats up, the foam then compresses in the areas where your body is curved. The compressed areas envelop your body and provide support, which is also soft so it also provides cushioning at the same time. Although you are enveloped, your body is still free from pressure and circulation is maintained at a smooth rate. 

This is why isotonic foam helps prevent tossing and turning and can relieve pains and aches in various parts of the body no matter what position you take while sleeping. 

One possible disadvantage of isotonic memory foam mattress pads is the price. Isotonic memory foam can be costly, which is why the memory foam mattress pads are also very pricey. However, they do offer a myriad more advantages than other types of mattress pads, such as the cotton and wool ones. 

Isotonic memory foam is also not just effective and advantageous; it is also very durable and can last longer, consequently they are usually worth buying.
